# Image-Processing-with-PIL-and-OpenCV-A-Hands-on-Approach
In this project, I explore image processing techniques using PIL (Pillow) and OpenCV, leveraging Matplotlib for visualization and NumPy for array manipulations. The project covers fundamental operations such as image reading, transformation, filtering, and visualization, providing a solid foundation for computer vision tasks.
